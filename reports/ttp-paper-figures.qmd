## Figure 1. Observed time-to-positivity trajectories

![Observed time-to-positivity trajectories in REMoxTB. Any observations at or above the diagnostic limit of detection (42 days) are recorded as 42 days. A: Regimen-level trends in TTP (lines) and estimated standard errors (ribbons) as fit by smoothing splines. B: Individual TTP trajectories (light gray) and regimen-level smoothing spline (black).](../graphs/descriptive/01_trajectories-remox-tb.png){width="80%" fig-align="right"}
